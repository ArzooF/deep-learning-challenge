# deep-learning-challenge
The project required developing a machine learning model to assist Alphabet Soup in selecting successful funding applicants.
A new repository named **deep-learning-challenge** was created and cloned.
The directory **Deep Learning Challenge** was created and pushed the initial changes to GitHub.
The dataset, charity_data.csv, was downloaded and preprocessed by handling categorical variables and splitting the data into features and targets.
A neural network model was built, compiled, and trained using TensorFlow to classify applicant success.
The model's performance was evaluated, and the results were saved in AlphabetSoupCharity.h5.
The model was optimized by adjusting various parameters and configurations, saving the improved model as AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.h5.
A comprehensive report was written, detailing data preprocessing, model design, optimization and performance.
Finally, all relevant files were copied into the repository and pushed to GitHub for submission.
